## Problem 1

Let $X_1,...,X_n$ be an i.i.d. sample from an exponential distirbution with the density function 

$$f(x|\tau)=\frac{1}{\tau}e^{-x/\tau}, \ 0 \leq x < \infty.$$

### (a) Find the MLE of $\tau$.



### (b) What is the exact sampling distribution of the MLE?



### (c) Use the Central Limit Theorem to find a normal approximation of the sampling distribution.



### (d) Show that the MLE is unbiased, and find its exact variance. (*Hint: The sum of the $X_i$ follows a gamma distribution.*)


### (e) Is there any other unbiased estimate with smaller variance?



### (f) Find the form of an approximate $(1-\alpha)*100\%$ confidence interval for $\tau$.



### (g) Find the form of an exact confidence interval for $\tau$.
